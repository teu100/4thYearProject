My first major issue on react native was that I wasnt being able to call my localhost api,I googled every solution possible.
Methods tried:
	- Use your computer ip address instead of "localHost"
	- Use "10.0.0.2" as it was the phone ip address
	- Also downloaded ngrok so I could change the address of my localHost but still didnt work
	- I tried making it a http request instead of https to see if it would work in the android simulator, as IOS dont allow http request as they are unsecure
Method that fixed it:
	- re done my api project as my old api project as it was a .NET framework project where i need a .NET Core web API
	- In my new project I used "" instead of sql queries like my last API
	- With my new api project I got a swagger page which is really nice as it was something i didnt have before with the other project
	- So, after getting all my queries to work in my new project I tried once again to connect react native to localhost then 
	- this was when I discovered that it wasnt my api that was the problem but something to do with react
	- After that I published my project in azure and react native was successfully able to connect to it and get result
Another problem I had was that I couldnt react native to call my api to move the task to a different column on the press of a button
Method tried:	
	- Pass in the id and the new statusColumn
		- The problem I had here was that I curl from swagger was saying that -H "accept: text/plain"
	- Pass in the whole task and status string
		-  Same problem as above
Method that fixed it:
	- Created a method that took in the task and statusString and called the put api to move a task
	- I passed in the whole object alone to the api but in the method that is calling the put request I set the statusString of the task object to wherever I want
	- Leave all the other vars as it is, and that worked
After getting that to work I ran into another problem which was that now that i am being able to pass the tasks I needed a way to refresh the list of task after I moved a task
Methods tried:
	- I tried to look for solution that could refresh the mobile page but it seem over the top so I didnt event try it
	- I tried making a method that called the useEffect method again which is useEffect but that didnt work and was giving me an error
	- With that I couldnt solve the error 
Method that fixed the problem:
	- I looked for a way to call the useEffect method inside a method, wasnt finding a solution
	- So I decided to read more about the useEffect method
	- I discover that I could pass the array that the useEffect method depended on as a second argument
	- Doing so useEffect would be called on it once a task changes
